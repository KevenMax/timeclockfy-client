# Timeclockfy
## About

Timeclockfy is an API time clock for managing employees' working hours.

Through this API, the employee's clock records can be managed.

As the API only supports the records, but as a roadmap we will add the possibility for the manager to approve or not the changes made to the records by the employees so that there is greater control.
